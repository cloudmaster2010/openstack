# Introduction(this page is under construction)
This page is to describe how to set configuration of OpenStack zun, kata, kuryr project, and nfs storage backend.
After these configurations, we can verify some functions like following:  
1. Check docker
2. Check zun
3. Check kata runtime
4. Check kuryr
5. Check nfs volume service
6. Create VMs with nfs volumes
7. Create containers with nfs volumes
8. Network test between containers
