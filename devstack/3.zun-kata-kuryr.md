# Introduction(this page is under construction)
This page is to demonstrate how to set the configuration of OpenStack zun, kata, kuryr project, and nfs storage backend. 
After these configurations, we can verify some functions like the following: 
 1. docker network
 2. zun container service
 3. kata runtime
 4. kuryr network for vm and container
 5. nfs volume service
 6. VMs with nfs volumes
 7. containers with nfs volumes
 8. Network verification between containers

# What are zun, kata, kuryr project?
## What is zun?
Zun is the OpenStack container service project, which aims to provide an API service for running application containers without managing servers or clusters.
Containers managed by zun are integrated with other OpenStack components, such as Neutron, Cinder, Glance, and Keystone.

## What is kata?
Kata container is an open source project working to build a secure container runtime with lightweight virtual machines that feel and perform like containers.
Kata container is an OCI compatiable runtime, ahdn thus plugs into both Docker and Kubenetes.
