# Introduction(this page is under construction)
This page is to demonstrate how to set the configuration of OpenStack zun, kata, kuryr project, and nfs storage backend. 
After these configurations, we can verify some functions like the following: 
 1. docker network
 2. zun container service
 3. kata runtime
 4. kuryr network for vm and container
 5. nfs volume service
 6. VMs with nfs volumes
 7. containers with nfs volumes
 8. Network verification between containers

# What are zun, kata, kuryr project?
## What is zun1?
Zun is the OpenStack container service, which aims to provide an API service for running application containers without managing servers of clusters.
